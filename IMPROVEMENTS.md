# Improvements and Next Steps

This project meets the lab requirements and shows a working three-tier architecture with network separation and load balancing.

If this setup were expanded further, a few simple improvements could be made.

## Possible Improvements

- Replace the database placeholder with a managed database instead of running it on a regular instance
- Add automatic scaling so the number of application servers can adjust if traffic increases
- Add basic monitoring and alerts to better track system health
- Automate the deployment instead of configuring everything manually

These changes would make the system easier to manage and more flexible without changing the overall structure.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation and can be extended step by step as needed.
